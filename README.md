 ## 🧩 About Me
 
I’m a backend-focused engineer who enjoys building systems that feel clean, predictable and maintainable.  
PHP is my main domain, and I work daily with modern architecture patterns, testing, and API design.  
My mindset is simple: **keep improving — one steady step at a time.**

---

## 🧰 What I work with

### 🖥️ Backend
- PHP 7–8.x, OOP, SOLID, clean architecture  
- Frameworks: CakePHP, Laravel  
- REST APIs, authentication/authorization, server-side logic  
- MySQL, Redis, Memcached databases
- Testing: PHPUnit / QUnitJS / TestCafe  
- Docker, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, deployment practices  

### 🌱 Also learning / experimenting
- Go — small tools and CLI utilities  
- React — basic frontend / interactive UI experiments  
- General DevOps / tooling / automation  

---

## 📘 My journey & learning style  
I believe in **steady growth over time**.  
I track my learning, experiments and ideas in a public [“daily-notes-2026”](https://github.com/serhii-panferov/daily-notes-2026)  repo to keep myself motivated and create a visible history of progress.

I value:  
- Clean, readable and maintainable code  
- Thoughtful architecture and good testing practices  
- Continuous learning and improvement  
- Balance between long-term planning and short, daily progress 

---

## 🎯 What I’m aiming for  
- Strengthen PHP backend skills, architecture and testing  
- Build and polish small tools and utilities in Go  
- Practice frontend fundamentals with React  
- Explore new solutions, improve workflow and automation  
- Contribute to open-source and learn from community
