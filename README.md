**Full-stack PHP Developer (9+ years)** building stable, clean and maintainable backend systems.  
I like crafting solid architecture, writing clear code, and constantly improving my technical skills.

## 🧰 What I work with

### 🖥️ Backend
- PHP 7–8.x, OOP, SOLID, clean architecture  
- Frameworks: CakePHP, Laravel  
- REST APIs, authentication/authorization, server-side logic  
- MySQL, Redis, databases  
- Testing: PHPUnit / QUnitJS / TestCafe  
- Docker, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, deployment practices  

### 🌱 Also learning / experimenting

## 📘 My journey & learning style  
I believe in **steady growth over time**.  
I track my learning, experiments and ideas in a public [“daily-notes-2026”](https://github.com/serhii-panferov/daily-notes-2026)  repo to keep myself motivated and create a visible history of progress.

I value:  
- Clean, readable and maintainable code  
- Thoughtful architecture and good testing practices  
- Continuous learning and improvement  
- Balance between long-term planning and short, daily progress
